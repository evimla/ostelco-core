# Stripe Monitoring and payment transactions check

## Monitoring

The service/cron-job script:

```
./prime/infra/stripe-monitor-task.yaml
```

can be used for verifying whether [Stripe](https://stripe.com) is reachable and
that the configuration is correct.

As part of the monitoring check, the list of "subscribed to" events with Stripe
is also checked. This list can be updated using the script:

```
./payment-processor/script/update-webhook.sh
```

On changes the corresponding list of events in `stripe-monitor-task.yaml` must
also be updated. For a list of events that can be subscribed to, see Stripes
[types of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types) documentation.


## Payment transactions check

Automatic check of whether payment transactions stored with Stripe matches
stored purchase records in the backed can be done using the service/cron-job
script:

```
./prime/infra/payment-transaction-check-task.yaml
```

## Status cron jobs

The status/output of the last few completed cron jobs can be checked as follows:

```
$ kubectl -n dev get pods

## Stripe health check

For Stripe API availability the endpoint `https://api.stripe.com/healthcheck`
can be used. Example:

```
$ curl -sS --stderr - -w "%{http_code}\n" https://api.stripe.com/healthcheck
frontend--03cc61e711c8b85c3.northwest-5.apiori.com at your service! What can I do for you today? (Up)
200
```

Check of this endpoint is currently not included as part of the
[monitoring](#monitoring) task, but can f.ex. be added as a
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) job or similar.
