## Exporter

This contains a set of scripts to generate the data for analayis. The export script
`export_data.sh` creates a new big query table with a new uuid which maps the pseudonyms to
msisdn. This table is then used to join the hourly data consumption to create a new
pseudonymised version of hourly consumption. The output doesn't contain msisdns. The output
table is then exported as a csv file in google cloud storage. There is also a script
`delete_export_data.sh` to delete these tables & files.

Currently this is deployed as a pod. The commands can be run by logging into the container.

Tables created:
1) exported_pseudonyms.<exportId> : The pseudonyms table, which can be used to reverse lookup msisdns
2) exported_data_consumption.<exportId> : The output hourly consumption table, used to export data to csv
