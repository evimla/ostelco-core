# Exploratory code for understanding the eSIM protocols

Based on information from
https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/SGP.22-v2.0.pdf

... Can the JSON files be interpreted as swagger spec, and be
converted into a server/client implementation?  If so can we use it to
flesh out the interaction between the BSS and the SM-DP+?

Use json schema files (stored in the resources directory of the
source code) to verify that the input / output is conformant to the
GSMA spec.  Use jackson's ordinary methods for handling incoming
requests and replies.


TODO:

* Verify that the protocol is actually sane (don't have _any_ examples
  of ES2+ interactions that can be used to check assumptions made
  during development.

* Introduce exception interceptors that catches exceptions 
  generated by the web resource, but encapsulates them in the
  ES2+-conformant JSON that the resource is supposed to produce.

* Use the generated openapi spec to generate clients.

* Test two-way SSL authentication.

* Make test-runs of some typical client/SM-DP+ interactions,
  possibly logging them using plant uml autogenerated
  diagrams.

* Connect to proper SM-DP+, watch everything explode
  ... observe fix repeat until it's working.

* Integrate into a proper workflow for subscriber signup,
  possibly involving generation of QR-codes :-)
