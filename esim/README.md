# Exploratory code for understanding the eSIM protocols

... Can the JSON files be interpreted as swagger spec, and be
converted into a server/client implementation?  If so can we use it to
flesh out the interaction between the BSS and the SM-DP+?

A guess:  It's json schema, which forms a subset of swagger.  If so, then
we could:

   * Use Jackson's json schema extension to typecheck incoming
     data to an implementation.

   * Make Jackson deserialize the incoming data into datastructures
     that we need to specify in an ordinary manner.

   * Use that serialization to generate a swagger spec, that will
     in general be more permissive than the json schema spec that
     contain multiple constraints on strings that are not
     easily captured in data structure definitions, but that's ok.

   * Using the OpenAPI extensions to dropwizard we can get
     an OpenAPI spec out of the implementation.

   * From that OpenAPI spec we can get autogenerated clients.

   * .. and at that point we will pretty much have a complete ES2+
     library that we can understand in all its glory.
