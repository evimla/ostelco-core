1. Make the basic envelope fit (headers etc.) modulo two-way TSL security.
  - Get jackson library
  - set headers, check headers etc.
2. Make the first of the requests bounce back and forth, use json schema for
   vallidation, but straight jackson for serialization/deserialization.
3. At that point, either extend to next type of messages, or add TSL
   two way, with self signed certs.
4. Rinse&repeat until complete.
