Some questions about the bigquery structure:

* We should use timestamps I think, since it's simpler to work with.

* We should also considere using ingestion-time partitioned tables

   - Most of our time-dependent queries will overlap reasonably
      sized shards (days, weeks, months), so that we don't have to
      table-scan _all_ of the potentially very large datasets we will
      accumulate.

* Don't name any field 'timestamp'. It leads to endless confusion
   with the datatype named 'timestamp', and the function called
   'timestamp'.
