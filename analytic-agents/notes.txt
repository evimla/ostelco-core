Some questions about the bigquery structure:

* We should use timestamps I think, since it's simpler to work with.

* We should also considere using ingestion-time partitioned tables

   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/creating-partitioned-tables

   - Most of our time-dependent queries will overlap reasonably
      sized shards (days, weeks, months), so that we don't have to
      table-scan _all_ of the potentially very large datasets we will
      accumulate.

* Don't name any field 'timestamp'. It leads to endless confusion
   with the datatype named 'timestamp', and the function called
   'timestamp'.

* We should decide if we will use camel case or snake case in
   offer descriptions. The current firebase/firestore structure uses
   both, and that is confusing.

* To get a FUSE mounted cloud storage on a mac, do this:
   https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcs-fuse
   Download from
   https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/
   https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/blob/master/docs/installing.md

       brew install gcsfuse
       sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_gcsfuse /sbin  # For mount(8) support


Make a certificate https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

To authenticate
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/some/path/pantel-credentials.json

then

   gcsfuse rmz-test-bucket /tmp/aaas
