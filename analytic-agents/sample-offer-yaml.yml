#
# This is a sample YAML format to be used by
# agents that produce offers.  The general idea
# is that an offer has a set of parameters,
# and also a set of selected subscribers that will
# get it.
#
# YAML was chosen since it's more human readable than
# e.g. json or protobuffers, while still being
# easy to produce by an agent, and relatively compact,
# in particular when gzipped.
