In this directory we have put files from repositories we had scattered
around, and that were for some reason or other deemed to be not fit
for the open source repository, mostly for privacy or security
reasons.  We have reviewed these directories, removed sensitive
information (email addresses to real people, mostly) and copied the
files in here.  They are not documented, sorry.  Also there is no git
history, since we couldn't find the time to review every commit for
security or privacy issues.
