/**
 * The sim  manager will have to interface to many different Home Subscriber Module
 * instances.  Many of these will rely on proprietary libraries to interface to the
 * HSS.  We strongly believe that the majority of the Ostelco project's source code
 * should be open sourced, but it is impossible to open source something that isn't ours,
 * so we can't open source HSS libraries, and we won't.
 *
 * Instead we'll do the next best thing: We'll make it simple to create adapters
 * for these libraries and make them available to the ostelco core.
 *
 * Our strategy is to make a service, implemented by the HssAdapterApplication, that
 * will be available as an external executable, via rest  (or possibly gRPC,  not decided
 * at the time this documentation is  being written).  The "simmanager" module of the open
 * source Prime component will then connect to the hss profilevendors and make requests for
 * activation/suspension/deletion.
 *
 * This component is written in the open source project, and it contains a non-proprietary
 * implementation of a simple HSS interface.   We provide this as a template so that when
 * proprietary code is added to this application, it can be done in the same way as the
 * simple non-proprietary implementation was added.  You are however expected to do that,
 * and make your service, deploy it separately and tell the prime component where it is
 * (typically using kubernetes service lookup or something similar).
