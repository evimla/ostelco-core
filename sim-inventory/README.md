# Exploratory code for understanding the eSIM protocols

Based on information from
https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/SGP.22-v2.0.pdf

... Can the JSON files be interpreted as swagger spec, and be
converted into a server/client implementation?  If so can we use it to
flesh out the interaction between the BSS and the SM-DP+?

Use json schema files (stored in the resources directory of the
source code) to verify that the input / output is conformant to the
GSMA spec.  Use jackson's ordinary methods for handling incoming
requests and replies.

TODO

* Re-enable json schema validation on  everything, fixing the broken 
  schemas in the process.

* Optimize data structures to make it nicer. E.g. by aoviding multiple empty classes

* Make some refactoring in the data structures. 

* Use the generated openapi spec to generate clients.

* Add  and test two-way SSL authentication.

* Make test-runs of some typical client/SM-DP+ interactions,
  possibly logging them using plant uml autogenerated
  diagrams.

* Connect to proper SM-DP+, watch everything explode
  ... observe fix repeat until it's working.

* Integrate into a proper workflow for subscriber signup,
  possibly involving generation of QR-codes :-)

* Figure out how to integrate with prime, possibly making the whole thing
  a part of prime.

* Figure out how to expose endpoints using google cloud endpoints, and
  preserving authentication for incoming ES2+ callbacks.
