# Workaround for ensuring correct path to dataset to be loaded into
# the SM-DP+ emulator appl. on startup.
# The "correct" way would have been to set the path using:
#     ConfigOverride.config("simBatchData",
#                 ResourceHelpers.resourceFilePath("sample-sim-batch.csv")
# when starting the SM-DP+ emulator in the test fixture, overriding
# the "simBatchData" config variable. Unfortunately Dropwizard will
# then set the "simBatchData" variable for all appl. that are started,
# causing start of the "sim-manager" appl. to fail as that appl. don't
# know (or use) this variable.
